# Project: Basic Programming Exercises
## Project Overview

This project consists of two simple programming problems designed to help students learn the basics of programming. It provides an opportunity to practice fundamental concepts such as input/output, conditionals, loops, and basic calculations using the C programming language.

### Problem 1: Trampoline Jumping to Reach a Specific Floor

#### Problem Description

The first problem involves Parsa, a student who wants to avoid using the elevator to reach a professor’s office on a specific floor. Instead, Parsa decides to use a trampoline located at specific positions in the building. Based on Parsa’s starting position and jump height, the task is to calculate how many jumps are required to reach the desired floor.

#### Problem Requirements:
- The program accepts an office number and the initial jump height as input.
- It determines the correct floor and office location and calculates the number of jumps required for Parsa to reach the professor's office.
- The program will output the zone number for the trampoline’s location and the number of jumps necessary.

#### Input:
- **Office number**: A three-digit integer representing the office number (e.g., 311).
- **Initial jump height**: A floating-point number representing the initial jump height in meters.

#### Output:
- The program outputs the zone number where the trampoline is located and the number of jumps needed for Parsa to reach the desired floor.

#### Example Output:

**Input**:  

    311    
    0.6  

**Output**:  

    3 #Zone  
    22 #Number of jumps

### Problem 2: Calorie Tracking and Weight Management

#### Problem Description

The second problem centers around Soheil, who is trying to control his weight by tracking the calories he consumes. The task is to help him track his calorie intake for several days and compare it with his daily caloric requirements. Based on this data, the program determines whether Soheil is gaining, losing, or maintaining his weight.

#### Problem Requirements:
- The program takes the number of days Soheil is tracking his food intake as input.
- It calculates the total calories consumed based on the food choices provided for each day.
- The program compares the total calories consumed with Soheil’s daily requirement (100 calories per day) and outputs whether he is gaining, losing, or maintaining weight.

#### Input:
- **Number of days (n)**: The total number of days Soheil is tracking.
- **Food choices for each day**: An integer representing the type of food Soheil consumes each day. Each food corresponds to a specific calorie value.

#### Output:
- The program outputs one of the following based on the comparison:
    - **"chagh"** (overweight)
    - **"laghar"** (underweight)
    - **"bedoon taghir"** (no weight change)

#### Example Output:

**Input**:  

    4  
    6  
    2  
    9  
    5  
**Output**:  
    chagh  
   



## Conclusion

This project is designed to help students practice the basics of programming. The problems focus on simple concepts like:
- Input and Output
- Conditional Statements
- Loops and Counting
- Basic Calculations

By solving these problems, students can develop a better understanding of how to write basic programs and perform simple data manipulation using C.
